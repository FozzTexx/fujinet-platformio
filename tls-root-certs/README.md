Here is the certdata from Mozilla's primary CA server, containing all of the root certificates that ship with Mozilla's browsers. We will need this for proper TLS support.

To be done:
-----------
* Implement a certificate store.
* Parse this file into certificate store.
* Implement code which verifies fingerprints against store.
